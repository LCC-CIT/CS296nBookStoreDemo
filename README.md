# CS296nBookStoreDemo
ASP.NET MVC demo web site for CS296N at Lane Community College
Written by Brian Bird

Demos for each week/topic are done on different branches
The branches are merged into the master at the end of each week,
but the branches are kept so students can see how the code was developed

## Branches
- Week 7: Authentication
- Week 8: Authorization
- Week 9: Migrations
